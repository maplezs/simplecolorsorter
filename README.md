# simplecolorsorter
## Sort simple things with bright colour like candy using TCS34725 Color Sensor and motor stepper but you can change to use Servo motor instead, the current code is only limited to 3 color only (red, green, blue), but you can always add more as many as you like but make sure to test the color range and accuracy first before adding to the main code
